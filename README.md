# Basic Text Editor

This is a simple web-based text editor built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides basic text editing features in a clean and minimal interface.

**Features:-**

* Create and edit plain text — like a Notepad in your browser

* Basic text formatting (e.g., bold, italic, underline) 

* Clear or reset the content easily

* Responsive and lightweight

**Technologies Used:-**

* *HTML —* for structure

* *CSS —* for styling the editor’s interface

* *JavaScript —* for editor logic, text formatting, and handling user interactions

**How It Works:-**

* **Editable Div / Textarea:** The editor uses contentEditable element where users can type freely.

* **Toolbar / Buttons:** Formatting buttons trigger JavaScript functions that apply styles (like bold or italic).
  
* **Event Handling:** JavaScript listens to user actions (button clicks, typing) and updates the content immediately.
